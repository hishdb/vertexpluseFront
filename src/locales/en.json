  "IndicesFaq": {
      "q1": "What is a stock market index and what does it measure?",
      "a1": "A stock index is a performance indicator or measure of a country's economy or of an industry sector. For example, Nasdaq 100 represents the largest 100 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. If, on average, the share price of these companies goes up, then the index will rise. Conversely, if they fall, the index will drop. Most main indices are based on a basket of shares and are thus considered good measures of the current market sentiment. When you take a position on an index, you are effectively investing in the performance of these shares and thus avoid factors that influence the performance of individual companies (such as a lack of market volume). For a full list of index futures CFD offered on the Plus500 platform",
      "q2": "What Are the Different Forms of Index Calculations?",
      "a2": "Stock market indices have different forms of calculation. These are the two most common: Adjusted market capitalisation (or cap-weighted) is used to track a number of companies based on the adjusted market capitalisation of the constituent stocks. Large-cap companies have a greater impact on the index’s price than small-cap companies. S&P 500 is an example of an index that is calculated this way. Price-weighted average – adds up the stock prices of all constituents, and then divides that figure by the total number of stocks in the index. Dow Jones is an example of an index that is calculated this way.",
      "q3": "How does leverage work in Index CFDs?",
      "a3": "By trading index futures contracts with leverage, you can multiply the value of a trade through the use of borrowed capital, and as such, you can increase the potential profit or loss to be realised from the trade. The available leverage for index CFDs on the Plus500 platform is up to 1:150.",
      "q4": "What are the highlights of trading Index CFDs?",
      "a4": "Here are a few highlights of trading Index CFDs: You can gain diversified exposure using a single instrument – as most factors that affect individual companies are taken out of the equation. More trading opportunities – we offer access to a wide range of indices from the world’s largest and most important stock markets.

    "q1": "What Does Forex Trading Mean and What Are Forex CFDs?",
    "a1": "What Does Forex Trading Mean and What Are Forex CFDs? Forex trading (also commonly known as Foreign Exchange, currency or FX trading) is a global market for trading one country’s currency in exchange for another country's currency. It serves as the backbone of international trade and investment: imports and exports of goods and services; financial transactions by governments, economic institutions or individuals; global tourism and travel – all these require the use of capital in the form of swapping one currency for a certain amount of another currency. When trading Forex CFDs, you are essentially speculating on the price changes in their exchange rate. For example, in the EUR/USD pair the value of one Euro (EUR) is determined in comparison to the US dollar (USD), and in the GBP/JPY pair the value of one British pound sterling (GBP) is quoted against the Japanese yen (JPY). If you think the exchange rate will rise you can open a ‘Buy’ position. Conversely, if you think the exchange rate will fall you can open a ‘Sell’ position.",
    "q2": "What economic factors may affect Forex rates?",
    "a2": "Forex rates are impacted by an array of political and economic factors relating to the difference in value of a currency or economic region in comparison to another country's currency, such as the US dollar (USD) versus the Offshore Chinese yuan (CNH) – these are the currencies of the two largest economies in the world. Among the factors that might influence Forex rates are the terms of trade, political relations and overall economic performance between the two countries or economic regions. This also includes their economic stability (for example GDP growth rate), interest and inflation rates, production of goods and services, and balance of payments.",
    "q3": "How is trading Forex different from trading the stock market?",
    "a3": "The 4 main differences between trading Forex and shares are: Trading volume – the Forex market has a larger trading volume than the stock market. Instrument diversity – there are thousands of stocks to choose from, as opposed to several dozen currency pairs. Market volatility – stock prices can fluctuate wildly from one day to the next, and their fluctuations are generally sharper than the ones found in Forex markets. Leverage ratios – the available leverage for Forex CFDs on the Plus500 platform is 1:300, while the leverage for shares CFDs is 1:20. Please note that when trading Forex or shares CFDs you do not actually own the underlying instrument, but are rather trading on their anticipated price change.",
    "q4": "What are the risks involved in Forex trading?",
    "a4": "Foreign Exchange trading has a number of risks that you should be aware of before opening a position. These include: Risks related to leverage – in volatile market conditions, leveraged trading can result in greater losses (as well as greater capital gains). Risks related to the issuing country – the political and economic stability of a country can affect its currency strength. In general, currencies from major economies have greater liquidity and generally lower volatility than those of developing countries. Risks related to interest rates – countries’ interest rate policy has a major effect on their exchange rates. When a country raises or lowers interest rates, its currency will usually rise or fall as a result. We offer risk management tools that can help you minimise your trading risks."

    "a1": "Futures Exchanges are markets where financial institutions and individuals can trade a wide variety of commodities. The world’s major exchanges for trading commodities are mainly located in the United States: Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) - a commodity futures exchange based in Chicago and operated by CME. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - an exchange based in Atlanta, focused on energy commodities. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) - an exchange located in New York City and operated by CME.",
    "q2": "How does commodity trading work?",
    "a2": "The most common way for trading commodities is to buy or sell a futures contract. The price of a commodity futures contract is standardised, meaning the underlying instrument’s quantity (pound, ounce, barrel, etc) is predetermined and appears the same for all market providers. A futures contract also obligates the holder to buy or sell a commodity at a predetermined price on a delivery date in the future. In CFD trading, once a commodity futures contract expires, a trader can either close the trade and open a new trade, or alternatively, allow the contract to roll over to the next month (if possible).",
    "q3": "How are raw materials traded as commodities?",
    "a3": "There are 3 main asset classes of commodities: Energies or Energy Commodities – refers to a variety of oil and gasoline-derived products needed for vehicles, generators and other engines. Among these are US-based West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil, international Brent Oil, extracted from the North Sea, as well as Natural Gas, Heating Oil and Gasoline. Metals, Precious Metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc) and Base Metals (Copper, etc) – refers primarily to Gold and Silver, originally used in the form of coins, bars and bullions, and issued by governments and central banks. Agriculture or Agricultural Commodities – consists of a wide range of soft commodities, i.e., crops and livestock that are grown, as opposed to metals that are mined or energies that are extracted. The most common agricultural commodities are Coffee, Wheat, Live Cattle, Corn and Soybeans.",
    "q4": "Where can you find historical commodity prices?",
    "a4": "Our charts allow you to go back and visualise the prices of futures contracts on commodities (for the current and previous months). You can use this information to draw upon past performance and develop your trading strategies. In addition, you can use our Economic Calendar to view a range of potentially market-moving events that have occurred already or are expected in the future.

    "a1": "Online stock trading means buying and selling shares of companies publicly traded on a stock exchange. The price of a particular stock is determined by the total number of shares a company has created, usually measured in the currency of the stock market it is listed on, for example, pence (in the UK), euro (in Europe), yen (in Japan) and US dollars (in the US). In line with the law of supply and demand, when there are more traders who want to buy a company than sell it, its stock price typically rises. Conversely, when there are more traders who want to sell a company than buy it, the stock price tends to decrease.",
    "q2": "What is stock CFD trading?",
    "a2": "CFD trading on shares is a form of trading that enables you to speculate on prices of publicly-listed companies traded on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and Tokyo Stock Exchange, without the need to own the underlying stocks. Another unique feature of stock CFD trading is the ability to increase your market exposure through leverage (or margin). This means you only need a fraction of the total trade value.",
    "q3": "How is trading the stock market different from trading Forex?",
    "a3": "The five main differences between trading shares and Forex are: Trading volume – the Forex market has a larger trading volume than the stock market. Instrument diversity – there are thousands of stocks to choose from, as opposed to several dozen currency pairs. Price effect – stocks’ prices are mainly affected by 'internal factors’, such as financial reports and other corporate events (dividends, stock splits, etc.), whereas Forex pairs are mostly influenced by 'external factors', such as positive or negative political and economic developments between countries/regions. Market volatility – stock prices can fluctuate wildly from one day to the next, and their fluctuations are generally sharper than the ones found in Forex markets. Leverage ratios – the available leverage for Forex CFDs on the Plus500 platform is 1:300, while the leverage for shares CFDs is 1:20.

    "q1": "What do you need to know about Options CFDs?",
    "a1": "When you trade options you are speculating on the future price (strike price) of an underlying instrument such as a stock, index or commodity. Plus500 offers two types of options CFDs: Call option and Put option - you can Buy or Sell both types. If you enter a position on a Call/Put option, you are essentially entering a contract on the price an underlying instrument will reach (or surpass) at the expiry date. Puts – A buyer/seller of a “Put Option” expects the price of the underlying instrument to fall/rise. Calls – A buyer/seller of a “Call Option” expects the price of the underlying instrument to rise/fall. For example, here is a breakdown of an option on Meta stock: Call 125 | Nov | Meta Call – The option type (can be either Call or Put). 125 – The strike price, i.e. the price you assume the underlying instrument will surpass at the expiry date. NOV (November 2018) – The option’s expiry date. In CFD trading, a popular form of day trading, your profit (or loss) is determined by reference to the movement of an option price. You are not buying or selling the option itself.",
    "q2": "What are the main benefits of trading options CFDs?",
    "a2": "Trading on options has some important advantages ou can experience higher volatility – percentage changes in options tend to be much more significant, meaning they can potentially deliver greater returns (along with greater risks). It's possible to open larger positions with lower initial margin as options' prices are substantially cheaper than their underlying instruments. For example, Alphabet (GOOG) is viewed by some traders as an expensive stock, while the price of an Alphabet option can often be much more affordable - meaning you can buy more units for the same amount of initial capital. You can diversify your positions by trading on various strike prices. A strike price is defined as the rate the underlying instrument needs to reach by the expiry time in order for the trade to be in profit. We offer multiple Put/Call options CFDs for each underlying instrument. Plus500 only offers trading in options CFDs. These options CFDs give you an exposure to changes in option prices, they are cash settled and cannot be exercised by or against you or result in delivery of the underlying security. Therefore, when the option CFD reaches its expiry date, the position will be closed.",
    "q3": "How does leverage work when trading options CFDS?",
    "a3": "How does leverage work when trading options CFDS? Plus500’s options CFDs allow you to amplify your market exposure without the need for a larger amount of capital. With a leverage of up to 1:5, for every $1,000 you deposit you can trade up to $5,000 worth of options. Accordingly, any potential profits or losses will be multiplied. For example, presuming the stock price of Apple is $200, while the current price of a Call option CFD for $250 (Call 250 | Nov | Apple) is $12 per option. With $120, you could open a trading position on 10 options, valued at $600: (10 Options x Option Price of $12) x Leverage of 5 = (10 x 12) x 5 = 600.",
    "q4": "How do options CFDs expire?",
    "a4": "Every option has a predefined expiry date. Typically set for one month ahead. As opposed to regular options traded in the market, Option CFDs' expiry date is set a few days before that of the underlying options. This is due to very low trading activity on the related contract at this time. On the date of expiry, the option CFD’s last price is based on the last available rate (and not zero).",
    "q5": "How are options CFDs priced?",
    "a5": "The main factors determining the price of an option include: (a) the current price of the underlying instrument, (b) the level of volatility in the market, (c) the expiry date and (d) the option’s intrinsic value, defined as the value any given option would have if it were exercised at present time. In addition, option prices are heavily influenced by their supply and demand in the market. Prices of options CFDs are referenced to the price movements of the options. When financial markets experience high volatility, Options CFDs’ percentage change tends to move more significantly than the underlying stock or index, due to an increase in implied volatility. Example 1: Alphabet (GOOG) is trading at $1,000, and you buy a Call option CFD of $1,100 for one month from now at $70. Two weeks later, Alphabet’s price goes up to $1,050, and the option CFD’s price is now $90. As such, your potential profit is 90-70 = $20 per option CFD. This is equivalent to a yield of 28% (20/70 = 0.28), which is much greater than if you would have bought an Alphabet share at $1,000, and profited 5% (50/1000 = 0.05). Example 2: Alphabet (GOOG) is trading at $1,000, and you buy a Call option CFD of $1,100 for one month from now at $70. Two weeks later, Alphabet’s price goes down to $950, and the option CFD’s price is now $50. As such, your potential loss is 50-70 = -$20 per option CFD. Equivalent to a 28% change of in the price (20/70 = 0.28), as opposed to having bought an Alphabet share at $1,000, and lost 5% (50/1000 = 0.05)."
